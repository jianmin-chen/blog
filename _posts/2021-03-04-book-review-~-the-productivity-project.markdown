As part of my mission to be able to understand and integrate productivity into my life, I recently read *The Productivity Project*. As it's title claims, this book is about a project centered around productivity, which was carried out by the book's author, Chris Bailey.

For a whole year, he researched productivity and conducted productivity experiments to try to become as productive as he could possibly be. This book is a culmination of that, and it's actually a pretty good read.

## Main Points
Basically, the book contains 25 productivity tactics that should have the most positive effects on your productivity. These tactics revolve around the three areas of productivity: **time**, **attention**, and **energy**.

### Time
The first part of this book is about time, and discusses ways to manage your time and procrastinate less. One of the great ideas I pulled from this section was setting three weekly tasks and three daily tasks. It sounds simple, but by doing this, you list out the three most *important* things you want to accomplish(because productivity isn't about how efficient you are, it's about how much you accomplish) in a week or in a day, and also lay out extra time for random issues that might pop up.

This section also discussed *biological prime time*, periods of time throughout the day when you have the most attention and energy and should therefore be doing your highest returning tasks, as well as procrastination triggers and what you should do to make a task set off less procrastination triggers - in other words, how to make a task more exciting. For me, I've personally created a procrastination list based off this book's advice - a list of what other things I could do besides work on something I'm procrastinating on so at the least I get something done.

Finally, this part talks about shrinking tasks, or removing low returning tasks, such as cleaning the house. In fact, the chapter on lumping together tasks such as cleaning the house and buying groceries was very useful for me - after reading the chapter, I set up a collection of maintenance tasks that I try to do on the weekend.

### Attention
After talking about time(and making it clear that time is not as important as attention or energy in today's society), Chris Bailey goes on to discuss attention, from organizing your ideas to the negative effects of multitasking to being deliberate in your tasks. Two chapters are devoted to organizing whatever your brain is storing so that your brain doesn't have to do that - because it's not a storage device. After reading these two chapters, I did a brain dump, and got a bunch of information in response that I had totally forgot over the last couple of months. I then organized this information with Notion - my app of choice for organizing my life - allowing me to see my goals and what I should be doing to nail them(it's worth noting that I used a altered version of the system that the book provides to make it easier for me to see my life in one place).

Like I mentioned before, this section also talked about multitasking, and working more deliberately. I'll admit that I glazed my eyes a bit over this section - I'm certainly not a heavy multitasker, but I do multitask sometimes. However, I am working towards doing tasks more deliberately, using this book.

### Energy
Finally, the last part talked about energy, and how to cultivate it better, by giving meditation a try, eating and drinking better, and creating a sleeping routine to get more shut eye. This part centered around habits by making one small change - for example, exercising for at least 15 minutes a day and slowly upping that amount to a comfortable level. I personally believe that making small changes to chip away at a habit or form a new one is a great idea, which is why I have a list of small changes I want to make, one by one.

## My Thoughts
Overall, it was a pretty good read. Stories and a few interesting interviews were sprinkled over the pages, which made it more interesting. The information definitely stuck in my head, and I'm currently trying out the ideas and tactics presented in the book.
