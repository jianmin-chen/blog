While watching a YouTube video, I came across the book *Show Your Work*, written by Austin Kleon. Although the book is short, I personally believe it does a good job of explaining why expressing and sharing our thoughts with others through online mediums such as blogs, YouTube, and whatever people use nowadays is beneficial for us in the long term.

## Main Points
Being the size of a postcard and containing 214 pages, the book itself is relatively small. However, the book manages to explain ten points which can be used by anyone who hates self-promotion but wants to put themselves out on the Internet for others(me). As the book writes, "...this book is about how to influence others by letting them steal from *you*." I'll try to explain these ten points below, and my thoughts on them.

### 1. You don't have to be a genius.
This part explains that anybody can share something they are passionate about, even beginners. In fact, this part explains that amateurs are actually better at teaching than experts because they're not afraid to make mistakes. The book quotes the Zen monk Shunryu Suzuki:

> In the beginner's mind, there are many possibilities. In the expert's mind, there are few.

### 2. Think process, not product.
Besides seeing the end result of a project, people also want to see the process behind it, maybe simply because they're interested in how the end result came to be or maybe because they want to replicate the results. Either way, the book explains, talking about your process is a great way to attract people who have the same interests as you.

### 3. Share something small everyday.
This one is possibly my favorite point out of all of them. It explains that if you manage to find the time to share something small every day, or week, or month, what you share can compound into something big and serve as an inspiration for another project.

### 4. Open up your cabinet of curiosities.
This one is about being open about what you like, and giving credit to those who influenced you.

### 5. Tell good stories.
The title for this one was pretty self-explanatory. This part goes into a little more detail about the dos and don'ts of tell, but the gist is that to get people to find you, you need to tell good stories or, in other words, provide value of some sort.

### 6. Teach what you know.
When you teach what you know, people who are interested in the same field as you are will come and provide you with advice as well. This leads to a virtuous cycle where you can get an "education" in return for teaching what you already know.

### 7. Don't turn into human spam.
Kleon describes "human spam" as people who aren't willing to listen to others but want others to listen to them. This part tells you straight up not to turn into one of these people, as these people tend to end up losing creativity. Listen to others, and respect and learn from them.

### 8. Learn to take a punch.
When you're online, there are always people who are going to criticize you. Learn to take punches! Some people will have actual criticism you can improve on, but others will just try to undermine you. Learn to ignore the latter type.

### 9. Sell out.
Once you've got people who are attracted to what you're sharing, you can decide to sell out and kindly ask people to support you financially(or in some other way). This part explains some typical options, such as having patrons, creating a mailing list, and so on.

### 10. Stick around.
This is another favorite point of mine(ideas that typically have to do with consistency are my favorite ideas). All this one tells you to do is to consistently share things. Let your previous project become an inspiration for your next. When you've learned enough of something, "start over" on something else and become a amateur again. This fuels a lifetime of learning and sharing.

This is all there is to the book, essentially!

## My Thoughts
This book was short, sweet, and to the point. This book presented a couple of great ideas that I could potentially use for improving my blog. Overall, it was a good quick read.

Anyways, if you have any questions, fire below!
