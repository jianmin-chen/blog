Besides reading [*The Productivity Project*]({% post_url 2021-03-04-book-review-~-the-productivity-project %}) this week, I also read *The $100 Startup*. This book's title pretty much explains what the book is about - starting a small business with a minimal amount of money! The book focuses on being able to run a small business that doesn't make you rich but provides you with more freedom.

To make it clear that creating a business isn't a impossible task, the author, Chris Guillebeau, decided to interview people who had been successful in creating sustainable microbusinesses. This book is essentially a collection of those interviews, and what can be learned from them.

## Main Points
The book's contents revolve around finding freedom by providing value - an important idea that is referenced throughout the book. Basically, if you can provide value in whatever business you're running, there will always be customers lining up to buy the products or services your business offers.

To provide value and still be able to do what you enjoy, you have to find an overlap between what you enjoy and what people want, also known as convergence. With this in mind, you can transform your skill into a way of making money. Chris actually makes this super clear by presenting a simple but relevant formula: `passion or skill + money = success`.

This is likely very obvious: people aren't going to buy what you provide if it's not useful. But Chris goes even further and simplifies what a business needs to be successful:

1. product or service: what you sell
2. people willing to pay for it: your customers
3. A way to get paid: how you'll exchange a product or service for money

Those are the basic necessities, and the book goes into more detail about how to nail each one. For example, how can you create a useful product or service? By *giving them the fish*, in which Chris means basically giving customers something that provides them with emotional benefits or takes away emotional detriment.

Continuing on, how can you attract customers? The book explains a few ways. One - create a offer they can't refuse. Chris explains this by telling the story of how he ran his first marathon in Seattle, and was offered a doughnut and slices of an orange midway through. Which offer did he accept? The slices, obviously - it was a offer he couldn't refuse because he knew it would boost his energy.

Two - try hustling. Build relationships with potential customers through writing guest posts, strategic giving, free giveaways, and so on. Although this part was a bit sparse and lacked some details for those new to hustling in my opinion, it really demonstrated the power of hustling and how it could do wonders for businesses.

Finally, the end of the book explains how to leverage your business to generate more income for you. Some of the principles on how to generate more income include:

* basing the costs of an product or service on benefits - the cost of the products or services you are offering should make sense to the buyer, not you
* offering a range of options for a product or service, a.k.a upselling
* making your product or services available as a subscription service

More ideas are presented in the book, such as measuring metrics to increase traffic, encouraging referrals, and so on.

"But What if I Fail?" happens to be the last chapter in the book. It's encouraging, and the main point of it is that even if you fail, you can get up again; just don't live a life that's not your own.

## My Thoughts
I enjoyed this book a lot. I actually read it a couple of times over and over again to really get into my head the ideas presented in the book - it's jam packed with information and while it does miss out on some information(as every book is likely to do), it's a very useful and inspiring book that I'll be sure to come back to.
