*Deep Work* is a book about doing deep work. Written in 2014, it's pretty old compared to some of the other books I've reviewed on this blog, but it's still useful. After all, the content in books don't typically get old, even if the books themselves do.

It talks about why deep work is valuable in today's economy and how what we, the reader, should do to cultivate it. Being used to checking my email and multitasking while doing my work, I found this book to be a very refreshing read.

## Main Points
The book's introduction starts out by talking about Carl Jung, one of the great psychologists of the 20th century, and how hiding away in a tower in Germany helped him to work deeply and, as a result, become one of the most celebrated psychologists of the 20th century. After presenting Jung as an example, the author, Cal Newport, presents his formal definitions for what **deep work** is:
> **Deep work**: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

He also explains what the opposite of deep work is:
> **Shallow work**: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

Clearly, in the 21st century, deep work is super important, especially for people who are "knowledge workers" or people whose main job is to deal with knowledge. As a result, it's extremely rare and valuable in today's economy. The book's job, then, is to explain just exactly why deep work is important, and how to cultivate it.

### Why Deep Work is Important
The first part of the book is about why deep work is important. One, deep work is valuable. In order to succeed in the new economy, knowledge workers need to be able to "quickly master hard things", and use what they've mastered to "produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed". Deep work can be used to accomplish both of these.

Two, deep work is rare. Because it's rare, most knowledge workers end up multitasking and checking their email or doing something completely unrelated to the project they're currently working on. *I'm extremely guilty of this, and I can say this is definitely one thing I'll remember from the book.* This leads to slower progress, and less results, which is both bad for the employee and the employer.

Last but not least, deep work is meaningful. This last chapter in Part I is more philosophical and explains that deep work might actually allow us to live a more meaningful life, since deep work is useful for placing meaning into a job or profession, which could lead us to recognize the accomplishments we've made in our personal lives, and therefore, create a streak of meaning in our life.

### How to Cultivate Deep Work
The second part of the book contains six rules for working deeply. I won't discuss this part in full detail, but there were a couple of points I liked in this part.

1. *Create a ritual.* In this part, Newport introduced a couple of philosophies for deep work scheduling, such as the monastic philosophy(fully eliminating shallow work at all times), the bimodal philosophy(dividing your time so certain periods are for deep work and others are for shallow work), the rhythmic philosophy(completing a set goal everyday, such as writing a page everyday in order to get a book done), and finally, the journalistic philosophy(working deeply whenever time is available, similar to a journalist). For me, it would also be useful to think about the questions he presented in this part, such as **where you'll work and for how long**, **how you'll work once you start to work**, and **how you'll support your work**.
2. *Be lazy.* Take breaks so that your brain can recharge. Taking breaks could also help "aid insights", which I've found to be true before when I've taken walks or done the dishes after stressing over a problem or a bug I was having inside my code, and finding the answer pop randomly out of the blue.
3. *Don't take breaks from distraction. Instead, take breaks from focus.* I feel like this point is one of those points that should be obvious, but isn't. Taking breaks from focus to give in distraction would actually be better than taking breaks from distraction to focus, because as the book explains it, it would train your concentration muscles and allow you to set a fixed period for when you work deeply.
4. *Work like Teddy Roosevelt*. This point is based off of how Theodore Roosevelt was able to juggle a bunch of commitments and hobbies during his time at college, while also succeeding in college: by working only on one thing with a great intensity.
5. *Schedule every minute of your day*. I really liked the reasoning behind this one. If you schedule your day fully, you could end up experiencing "*more* creative insights than someone who adopts a more traditionally 'spontaneous' approach when the day is left open and unstructured", because you could end up making great progress on a project you happen to be in the mood for and also get other things done simply by scheduling and then altering your schedule as needed.

## Conclusion
> *What? You say that full energy given to those sixteen hours will lessen the value of the business eight? Not so. On the contrary, it will assuredly increase the value of the business eight. One of the chief things which my typical man has to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change - not rest, except in sleep.*

This is a quote from 20th century self-help writer, Arnold Bennett, that was used in the book. To me, this quote demonstrates that even deep work outside of work is meaningful, and that deep work in general is meaningful. We don't want rest, we want change. We want to be able to feel a sense of accomplishment, and deep work can help us do that.

Anyways, the book was very useful for me, and I hope it's useful for you too. If you have any questions, feel free to ask below!
