I started reading *Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance* last week and finally finished this week. As you might have guessed, *Grit* is a book about, well, grit. It talks about what grit is, why it's so important in today's society, and what you can do to cultivate it, and includes short stories and anecdotes along the way, which makes it a entertaining read.

## Main Points

<a href="https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-book/" style="display: block; margin-top: 25px; text-align: center; width: 100%;">The grit equation</a>
The information inside *Grit* can be divided into three parts: what grit is and why it matters, how grit can be grown from the inside-out, and what parents and mentors can do to help others become more gritty.

Well, okay, what is grit? The first part of the book tackles what grit is, and why it's so important. Grit, as the author, Angela Duckworth, explains it, can be broadly defined as `passion + perseverance` - a direction to travel in and the ability to keep traveling in that direction, even in the face of obstacles. The author starts this part by introducing some of the interviews and studies she's done in order to grasp what all successful people have in common - grit.

She also explains that we tend to overestimate the talent that successful people have, by presenting the most important equations in the book:
~~~
talent × effort = skill
skill × effort = achievement
talent × effort × effort = achievement
~~~
These equations demonstrate that talent and effort are both important in mastering and achieving, but that effort, or grit, is worth *two* times more than talent, something she points out we tend to overlook. If there's anything in the book I remembered, it was these equations.

After giving a definition of what grit is, the book presents a short pop quiz that allows you to compare yourself to American adults in terms of grit. The book reassures you that if you didn't score as well as you thought you would on the scale, that's fine - that's what the next part of the book is about!

In fact, the next part of the book is about "growing grit from the inside out". There are three, seemingly simple steps: finding your passion(s) and top-level goals, deliberately practicing to get closer to your top-level goals, and finding the purpose and hope to keep going. These steps are individually explained in thorough detail.

Finally, the last part of this book explains how teachers and mentors can positively influence the grit of others. Most of Duckworth's advice here is aimed at adults, but can apply to mentors, teachers, and so forth. She talks about growth mindset and how parents can direct their children's growth mindset in a positive direction, thus increasing their grit as they learn not to give up and be optimistic. She also explains hat parents should be supportive but at the same time demanding of their kids, and finally sums up the part by explaining why extracurriculars are great for increasing grit in children.

## My Thoughts
This book was a pretty good read. It was motivating, and at the same time, informational. Obviously, reading a book about grit will not turn me into a paragon of grit overnight, but I'm excited to follow the methods outlined in the book for growing my grit!
