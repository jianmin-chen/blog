title: Why I Write Book Reviews
---
![Stacked books](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/FZ5KthqQyesT3qWKtWILPDwhZVxoge7Wb2xUO9FNYrOTu5GunzzjVk7Ac2PLm1Gi1BkUqfuOVIFHULQionX_nnVgW7Pn8io)

On my blog, I sometimes write about books I've read. These books typically fall into the self-help and creativity categories(though I read a lot of books that don't necessarily fit into these genres as a bookworm), and the posts I write for them include what I've learned from the book and what my thoughts were of it.

The main reason why I do this is to **reiterate what I've learned for my own purposes**. Oftentimes, I forget what I've read in a book, especially if I only read it once or skimmed over it because the book was boring. Writing book reviews helps me to pull out important points from a book that would otherwise blur with the rest of the content in the book. As a result, I'm more likely to remember the lessons in a book and how to apply them in my life.

Of course, once I've written a book review, it's always there. I can always reference it again if I want to get a summary of the book the book review is about. This is useful for when I'm doing a review of what I've learned.

Finally, seeing what I've written on my blog reminds me of the progress I've made. It adds a bit of meaning. Even if nobody is reading my blog, I can read it and see my past self. Writing book reviews and blog posts in general help to encourage my creativity, and it's something I'm proud of.

Anyways, this post is short because, well, it's straight to the point. If you do something similar, tell me about it in the comments below!
