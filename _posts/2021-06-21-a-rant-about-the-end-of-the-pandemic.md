It's the end of the pandemic, and I've just realized.

Of course, being the person I am, I find myself thinking about the past year. It's been... the pandemic has been a life-changing period of time, despite how cliché that sounds. I imagine how it must feel for others, especially those who happen to be recent graduates. How does it feel to stay remote for half the year, miss prom, and then attend your graduation ceremony? Does it feel incomplete? The pandemic has made everything feel incomplete, but there's no denying that it was a crucial start to the new decade.

I remember the start of the pandemic like it happened yesterday. At first it seemed like a minuscule, tiny problem that could be fixed easily. Then the number of COVID-19 cases grew. And grew. On March 12, 2020, I found out that there wouldn't be school for a week. I remember feeling excited. Early spring break, yay! But a week grew into two, and two grew into a month, and it was revealed that there wouldn't be any more school for the rest of the year.

During that time, I was dazed. Bored. And I realized how much school played a role in my life, so I decided I needed something to do to make up for the missing school time, because I felt incomplete. Like I was heading in the wrong direction. To this day, I still have such a sense of wrongness if I don't have anything to do.

Change causes domino effects. The pandemic was an inevitable change in the structure of my life, so of course, I changed too. At first, all I did was spend more time scrolling through my phone. Later on, when I had the revelation that I needed something to keep me busy, I dived back into programming. I discovered the self-help and productivity sections on YouTube. I had fun reading classics and other books that I normally would have never had the time to read. For the first time in my life, I went hiking. I went to the beach multiple times too, and I felt... carefree, ironically. Despite the fact that the pandemic was at its worst during the time I did these activities, I felt carefree. These seem like small changes, and they were, but they made me feel like I was going in the right direction.

Over the course of 2020 I would weave in and out of this rabbit hole, as I attempted to figure out my identity in this new decade. At the same time, the new year came, and that's when I started this - this blog - and climbed out of the hole I had dug for myself again.

Once again, I'll make the same cliché statement - the pandemic changed my life. Maybe not as much as it changed the lives of Newton - who discovered the Laws of Motion during a pandemic - or Shakespeare - who wrote a few plays with details inspired by the pandemics he had to deal with - but I can argue that it changed each of our lives for the better or the worst. *Stoicism* is about understanding that you can only have control of yourself. You don't have control over anything else, and the pandemic helped me learn that.
