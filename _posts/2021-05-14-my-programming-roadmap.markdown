title: My Programming Roadmap
---
![Road image](https://toggl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/how-to-build-a-product-roadmap.jpg)

Something I've been thinking about recently is how I'm going to go about learning programming. I have a lot of varied interests in the field, but I've been considering how I could possibly consolidate all those interests into a learning roadmap that could benefit me in the long run.

Now, as I mentioned before, programming can vary widely, from game development to artificial intelligence/machine learning. I've always been interested in a few categories:
* **Web development**: I've always been interested in web development and what I can do with it. I have experience with full-stack web development, but I'm looking to solidify my experience by learning a couple of tools in more detail, which is overwhelming since there's simply so much frameworks and libraries out there in different programming languages.
* **Competitive programming**: Part of the reason why I'm interested in competitive programming is that it's helpful for finding jobs related to programming, and it fosters learning of computer science concepts(one of those topics that are boring but necessary), through competition.

While I do dabble in other fields like game development(which got me into programming in the first place), and are interested in other fields(artificial intelligence and machine learning), I believe that now isn't the right time to pursue them(when I do decide to create a new learning roadmap, I will be sure to update this blog post or write a new one).

### Motive
Before I explain my thinking process for how I'm going to learn these two, I'd like to explain why I'm writing this post. Basically, this post serves as a reminder for me that these are my plans, and will motivate me to keep going.

Okay, let's get started! The way I'm organizing my roadmap is by topic, but the timeline for all of them is asynchronous(so I might be learning something in one topic at the same time I'm learning from the other).

## Web Development

![Web development image](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/04/screely-1586183781361.png)

The first topic I'm planning to dive into is web development. I already have some knowledge in it, but I'm looking to further my skills since there's just so much I don't understand(the beauty of programming). At the time I'm writing this, I'm currently taking the online version of [*CS50*](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/), a computer science course for those new to programming. I'm working on my final project in this course, and I'm planning to finish it by the end of June 2021. It's already taught me the basics of web development, especially the basics of Flask, a Python framework for web development.

After I finish the course, I'm going to go on a break and share my knowledge with the world through a little GitHub organization I'll be creating. Pretty exciting! This is something I hope to be done with by the end of August 2021(I'm a student and here's to me hoping to take advantage of summer break).

Then, I'm going to take another course that derives from CS50. This one is known as [*CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript*](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/), and it explains a lot of web development topics I don't have much experience in yet, such as Git, Django(another Python framework for web development, used by companies like Instagram), SQL models and migrations, CI/CD(continuous integration and development, which I know nothing about), and scalability as well as security. By the end of this course, which I'm hoping to finish by the end of December 2021, I'll hopefully have enough full-stack knowledge to be able to code a entire web application and then maintain it.

In addition to taking this course, I also plan to perfect my full-stack skills during this time, especially since I'm a self-taught programmer and have tidbits of knowledge here and there in full-stack web development. When it comes to CSS, I have general knowledge of Bootstrap, but often find myself referencing the documentation. I'd rather learn [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), which is a "utility-based framework" or basically a CSS framework that allows me to write less CSS. To learn TailwindCSS, I'm planning to take a look at their documentation and slowly work my way through it by creating HTML/CSS designs.

When it comes to JavaScript, I'm super interested in learning more about React + Redux. CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript introduces React, but I'd also like to learn Redux with it. [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) seems to be a good choice for this, so I'll be learning React and Redux using it.

That's my short plan for learning web development! Obviously, there's other topics and alternative frameworks I could use(e.g, Express with NodeJS, Ruby On Rails, etc.), but the above seems to provide a reasonable amount of web programming knowledge.

## Competitive Programming

![Competitive programming image](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200413121827/cpp-library1.png)

The next topic I want to delve into is competitive programming, which is basically writing code to solve programming problems that go along the lines of what you'd normally be asked in a job interview for programming. In other words, you need to have knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and problem solving methods, which are not just applicable in this field but in **every** field of programming.

Now, GitHub has a lot of competitive programming repositories. These are the ones I've starred or bookmarked and am planning to use:
* [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university): Even though this is for coding interviews, it's still useful for comptetitive programming. As a checklist, it's very in-depth and provides a bunch of resources for learning algorithms and data structures.
* [Awesome Competitive Programming](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming): A list of competitive programming resources and courses, which could come in handy.

Scrolling through these repositories and the Internet, I found out that two programming languages are typically used in competitive programming: Java and C++. After debating it for a while, I decided on using Java, as the books I'm learning from are typically written in Java. Furthermore, high schools typically teach AP Computer Science A/B in Java, making Java slightly more attractive then C++. As a result, I'll be learning Java using this book:

![Think Java book](https://greenteapress.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/think_java_covr_large.png)

After finishing this book, hopefully by the end of August 2021, I'm planning to move on to the next logical step in January 2022 - learning algorithms and data structures. The book I'm planning to learn from is the renowned *Algorithms* book by Robert Sedgewick, and lucky for me, it's written in Java! However, this only covers algorithms. This is where the GitHub repositories I starred comes in. Coding Interview University provides a list of important data structures, as well as videos and implementations for them that will come in handy. Learning from these two resources will take a long period of time, so I'm putting aside half of the year to learn from these two. in other words, I hope to have a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures by June 2022.

Once I've learned algorithms and data structures(I'll definitely share my progress on this blog), the next logical step is to practice solving programming problems. I don't know a lot about competitive programming competitions and how they work just yet, but I'm excited to learn. However, at the moment, I'm planning to do problems from three different resources:
1. *Cracking the Coding Interview*: Well-known book used by people who are preparing for job interviews. This book is written in Java and has over 150 problems, so it's definitely going to be useful.
2. *Programming Interviews Exposed: Coding Your Way Through the Interview*: Another book on coding interviews, with coding problems that are explained and discussed more in-depth.
3. USACO: USACO's online training page provides a bunch of example problems too,and presents them similar to how programming problems would be presented in a actual competition, so I'll be using it as well.

This is my plan for learning competitive programming! It's certainly going to be tough considering the lack of knowledge I have in algorithms and data structures, but I love a good programming challenge. After I'm done with the above resources, I plan to poke my nose deeper into the competitive programming competitions that are out there.

## Conclusion
This is my learning roadmap for the next two years or so. To recap:
- [ ] June 2021: Finish CS50
- [ ] August 2021: Read and learn from *Think Java*
- [ ] December 2021: Finish CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript and perfect my tech stack
- [ ] June 2022: Get a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms
- [ ] Onward from June 2022: Practice competitive programming problems and participate in competitions

I'm excited to get started! A consistently updated version of this checklist can be found on the [main](https://jianmin-chen.github.io/blog) page of this blog, if you're interested. In addition, as I work on this plan, I'll definitely be writing posts about what I'm learning. If you have any questions or comments though, feel free to fire below!
