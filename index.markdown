Hi! I'm Jianmin Chen.

As a self-taught, or as I like to call it, self-teaching programmer, I get excited whenever I hear about programming. I discovered programming around four years ago, when I found a book on programming while exploring my local library. For two years, I didn't think much about it and even almost forgot about it, but I rekindled my love of programming in 2019 when I discovered *Sololearn*, a app where I could talk to and interact with other programmers(although I'm currently taking a break off the app to work on other projects).

Since then, I've gained experience in and dabbled with:

* Python for web development and web scraping
* C for basic computer science concepts
* HTML/CSS and Bootstrap
* JavaScript and React, which was actually pretty easy to pick up
* A bunch of other programming languages that I can't say I have much experience in

Of course, the mantra of programming must be something like "just keep learning", meaning I'm still learning all sorts of things - there's so much out there to do and learn, which makes programming genuinely interesting! In fact, I'm currently following a roadmap to learn programming:
- [X] June 2021: Finish CS50
- [ ] August 2021: Read and learn from *Think Java*
- [ ] December 2021: Finish CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
- [ ] June 2022: Get a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms
- [ ] Onward from June 2022: Practice competitive programming problems and participate in competitions
