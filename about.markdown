Hi! I'm Jianmin Chen.

As a self-taught, or as I like to call it, self-teaching programmer, I get excited whenever I hear about programming. I discovered programming around four years ago, when I found a book on programming while exploring my local library. For two years, I didn't think much about it and even almost forgot about programming, but I rekindled my love of programming in 2019 when I discovered *Sololearn*, a app where I could talk to and interact with other programmers(although I'm currently taking a break off the app to work on other projects).

Since then, I've gained experience in and dabbled with:

* Python for web development and web scraping
* C to get basic computer science concepts nailed down
* HTML/CSS and Bootstrap
* JavaScript and React, which was actually pretty easy to pick up

Of course, the mantra of programming must be something like "just keep learning", meaning I'm still learning all sorts of things - there's so much out there to do and learn, which makes programming genuinely interesting!
